            <h1>First personal website</h1>
            <p>Since this is my first attempt at creating any sort of website, I really just wanted to showcase a few of the skills I've learned from the Flatiron School prework so far.</p>
            <p>A keen eye will note a few of the lesson items:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>managing page content & structure with HTML</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>including nested elements</li>
                        <li>structural div containers</li>
                        <li>id and class labeling for easier CSS management</li>
                        <li>use of most common HTML tags, like <a href='https://www.instagram.com/theattentionthor/?hl=en'>fancy links</a></li>
                    </ul>
                <li>handling visuals and styling with CSS</li>
                <li>integration of interactive elements with some (light) JavaScript and event handling</li>
                <li>not really sure how to fix the spacing on the images, but I definitely tried!</li>
            </ul>
